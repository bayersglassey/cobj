Currently map_parser fails, probably because our data types aren't copy-on-write!!!
Whoops.

    -> Man, this is a big reason why refcounting is nice for us.
        Then we know when we have to copy things (that is, "make them unique").



Byte literals

    One of these:

        {byte}"A" 65 == assert
        {byte}A 65 == assert

    ...Using a sym is maybe nicer otherwise we have to allocate
    a whole obj_str?..
    Or I suppose it doesn't matter either way because parser
    should handle typecasts directly?..
