We need to add OBJ_DEF_GET_IN, OBJ_DEF_GET_OUT.
Then call and longcall need to look at def's "in" to figure out how many
args to copy over to new stack.
And obj_vm_step needs to look at def's "out" to figure out how many
values to copy back to parent stack.


It would be nice if we could edit lists.
Currently, NIL takes 1 obj_t, CELL takes 2.
If NIL took 2 (second one unused), then we could turn it into CELL in-place.
Then we could implement a destructive obj_list_append(obj, val).
